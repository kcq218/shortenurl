# Shorten URL
I wanted to understand how long urls are condensed into short resusable urls, and I wanted to build this in the cloud.
After some research I decided to create a full project out of it.

-Be able to generate a shorten url when given an input that is a valid URL
-The URL generated should be a valid url that maps back to the original destination
-When given an existing url in the system return the existing shorten url
-the shorten urls are unique


Technical Requirements

-Utilize Azure as a Cloud Platform
-Create microservices via functions
-Use Keyvault for App Settings
-Understand how to use App Insights and be able to write custom logs to the Service
-Create Enterprise level software by using Repository/UnitofWork Pattern
-Leverage Dependency Injection to create unit test, and decouple dependencies from classes
-Create Unit Tests and have 90% code coverage for all microservices
-Set Budget Alerts when 50% of the budget is reached
